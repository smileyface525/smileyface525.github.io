			<h2>Amazon.com</h2>
			<p>
				I think amazon.com is my absolute favorite. Their home page is a little bit busy since it's full of advertizements and product pictures but it is still very easy and intuitive to get to where I want to go. Obviously, I use the website to shop, so when I'm on amazon.com, I would be looking for a paticular product or checking out my wish list to see if I'd like to purchase something from that list. <br>
				By using the search bar or the department list, I am always able to find what I'm looking for. If I'm looking for a sepecific product, I use the search bar. It has an autocomplete function so i don't have to type the whole name, and it also gives me the option to search in a paticulat depatment if I want to narrow down the list.<br>
				The Department list is awesome too. It is full of ( not too many ) sublists so it is usually easy for me to pinpoint the things I'm looking for from the list.<br>
				Thier wish list also one of my favorite features. I get to make multiple wish lists and it is so easy to edit them.<br>

			<h2>American Express</h2>
			<p>
				I like their website because of its both functionality and design.<br>
				I usually use the site to check my card activity or make an payment. So most of my time on their web is spent on my account page. Their simple desgin makes it a lot easier to undersand the account snapshopt. Their accout page is so simple, cool looging and easy that it sometimes makes me think if there are more things I can do on it so I can stay on their website longer. It is very easy, functioanl and stylish website, and I always enjoy gettting my stuff done on it.<br>
			</p>
			<h2>Google.com</h2>
			<p>
				Although it is an obvious choice, I had to include it! Needless to say, it is very useful, practical and vey imformative. I love thier simple design. As much information and functionalites that they offer, their desgin is kept to the minimun, and I like that a lot. It make it very easy to look up information and also to navigate through different serives they offer (i.e. "gmail", "google+", "youtube"...).<br>
