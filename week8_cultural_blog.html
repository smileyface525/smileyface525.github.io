					I enjoyed listing to Shareef's Fireside Chat very much. I'm glad that I got to watch this
				video before the phase 1 starts because he answered many questions I had about DBC and listing
				to what he had to say made me feel a lot better.
					I totally get the idea of Kitchen vs. Restaurants and how a mindset of working in the kitchen with
				other chefs is more affective to learn. And I can definitely see that that kind of enviroment having a huge 
				positive affect on me. Even though I lite the idea of working and learning together with people, I feel like I was
				never really good at it, and because of that, I never really exposed myself to those kind of situations where
				I have to work with peolpe and share my thoughts with them.  
					I'm not going to lie, I am still pretty nervous about how well I'll do in that sort of enviroment at DBC, 
				I have a good feeling about it and I an super excited to experience the whole thing with my class mates!
