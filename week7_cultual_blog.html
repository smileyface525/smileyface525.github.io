				I think that when I feel stereotype threat, it's the best time to focus on yourself and think about nothing else. This is not so easy to do and  somthing to get used to, but once you learn how to do it, it is a great way to redirect the focus to yourself.<br><br> 
				The reason I like to do this is because I've been noticing that whenever I feel sad and down, that is because I'm doing one of these three things: comparing myself to others, regretting the past or worrying about the future. So I figured that it's very important for me to focus on my self and now.<br><br>
				Like I said, this is not easy, but I just start telling myself that I believe in myself and I only care about what I think of myself. I repeat this and just try to calm myself. Soon enough, I'd find myself feeling much better.
