			<p>We all use PCs every day, but do we know how they work? I sure don’t! So let's find out…	</p>
			<h3>What’s inside of a PC? Let’s learn about its parts.</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Case</h4>
					<p>PC needs something to cover the rest of the components.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Motherboard</h4>
					<p>All the other components go through here. Some important components (including CMOS) are directly 
						connected to the motherboard.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Power supply</h4>
					<p>PC needs this to work!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h4>
					<p>Also called professor which makes a computer a computer. This is the heart of a PC and determines 
						how the hardware and software perform.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>RAM (Random Access Memory)</h4>
					<p>Helps the CPU’s performance by temporality holding information while the CPU  is being processed.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Cooling Devises</h4>
					<p>Cools off the PC.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Cables</h4>
					<p>Connects the components together.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Graphic Components</h4>
					<p>Helps CPU process complex graphics data.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Ports</h4>
					<p>Places where you can plug in cables includeing , USB and Ethernet.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Peripherals</h4>
					<p>Monitor, keyboard, mouse, speaker, printer, etc…</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Expansion slots</h4>
					<p>A place extra components (called cards) can go.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Starting a PC</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Push the button!</li>
				<li>Start button activates the power supply in the PC which sends the power to the motherboard and other components.</li>
				<li>The PC performs the POST(Power-On Self-Test). The POST is a small computer program within the BIOS that checks for hardware failures. A beep that you hear when you start a PC means that everything went ok, if you hear multiple beeps, something went wrong</li>
				<li>PC displays the status of the booting process including BIOS manufacturer and revision, professor specs, the amount of RAM installed, and the drives detected.</li>
				<li>The BIOS attempts to access the first sector of the drive which contains the operating system.</li>
				<li>The BIOS confirms there’s a bootstrap loafer, and loads that boot loader into RAM. The boot loader is a small program designed to find and launch the OS.</li>
				<li>Once the boot loader is in memory, the BIOS hands over its work to the boot loader, which starts loading the OS into memory.</li>
				<li>Once the boot loader is done with its work, the OS takes over the control of the PC.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Now That the PC is started properly, the OS can do its jobs which include…</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Processor management</li>
				<li>Memory management</li>
				<li>Device management</li>
				<li>Storage management</li>
				<li>Application interface</li>
			</ul>
