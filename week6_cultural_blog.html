			<h4>My experience</h4>
			<p>
				As a Japanese international student, I've always felt somewhat threatened by my language barrier and cultural difference even though I never really had an incident that somebody made a fun of my English or lack of my knowledge. Interestingly, it's usually been the case that people get surprised by the fact that I have fewer accents than most Japanese people. Not only that, when I sincerely show my lack of knowledge on American culture, people usually seem to appreciate my honesty and even help me learn new things.

			<h4>How do I fix it?</h4>
			<p>
				I think it's important that I don't blame myself when I feel stereotype threat and get fixated on the fact that I feel it.  Just let it happen, but at the same time, keep reminding myself that I believe in myself no matter what. I know that this sounds cliche and maybe a little ambiguous, but stereotype threat and other self-destroying thoughts come from the lack of self-belief. Whether conscious or unconscious, I've feeding myself a negative image of myself and no matter what others think, this self-image won't go away unless I get rid of it. The way to do that is to do the same thing I've been doing to myself but with positive image. I think that is the ultimate solution to combat stereotype threat
