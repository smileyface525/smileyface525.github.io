			<h4>My Own Assessment During Phase 0</h4>
			<p>
				Gregorc's Mind Styles Model makes a suprisingly good sense to me because what I stuggled most during 
				phase 0 were blogging and pairing.<br>
				Aside from the fact that I don't really like wrting, I'm just not good at sharing my thoughts with others.
				It's not that I don't care about the subject but I am very shy when it comes to exposing my feelings and thoughts
				I think because I'm afraid of rejection. And also I just don't think that people care so much to hear ehat I have to say and
				I don't want to bore them.<br>
				Pairing was a little hard for me for the similar reason. Even though I had a great time paring every one of my partners but
				I can tell that I'm not at my most confortable level. What I experinced was, however, that I gradually got used to paring and didn't 
				feel unconfortable as much as I used to and I am glad that pairing was one of the requirements because I did learn a lot from others and
				O also got to know my future class mates in advance!

			<h4>Strategy for Phase 1 and beyond at DBC</h4>
			<p>
				I think that its't the best to have a simple plan so that I won't constantly thinking about what I'm supposed to do during
				school. I just need focus on why I decided to go to DBC. I wanted to learn programming and become a good programmer with people
				who have the same goal. Also, have completely different experience from the past and expose myself to new things. WHen I think about 
				all the reasons why I made the choice, it makes me feel better I feel a little unconfortable because at the end, I think to myself, "that's exactly how I should be feeling!".
