      <h4>On Pairing</h4>

            <h5>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</h5>
            <p>
              So far, I've done six paring sessions including two GPS sessions, and all of them have been very pleasant. In the beginning, I was a little nervous to work with people I never over vedeo call but I'm definitely getting used to it and feeling more comfortable now that I've worked with several studends. Because all of us have the same goal, which is to become a good programmer, it's very easy to work together. Everybody is helpful, attentetive, patient and hard working, so there really no reason for me not to enjoy working with these peolple.

            <h5>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</h5>
            <p>
            It is definitly comforting to have somebody to solve a problem with bacause it can get pretty tough working alone. Having someone to talk about how to approach a problem, come up with the psudocode and code makes the process much eaisier and fun. I also enjoy learing new techniques or mehtods I didn't know about from my peers.

            <h5>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</h5>
            <p>
              I think being open to suggestions and new ideas is a must when it comes to pairing. This is pretty oubvius considering the fact that purpose of pairing is to share thughts ans ideas to improve each other. Fortunately, I haven't really had a session where I felt ftustrated with my peer but I think that is because all of my pairing partner so far have been very open and understanding.<br>

      <h4>On Feedback</h4>
      <h5>Receiving feedback</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <h5>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</h5>
        <p>
          Very nice! I was reliefed to find out that all of my pairing partners had a plesnt session with me.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</h5>
          <p>
          Definitely. I was able to learn what people expect from having a peer pairing session and also from their partner. I can use these information to improve myself for future sessions.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</h5>
          <p>
           From the feedback I received I learned that they all appriciate flexibility, patience and willingness to work. So these are the words I definitelt keep in mind for my next session.

      <h4>Writing Feedbck</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <h5>How was it to write feedback?</h5>
        <p>
        I don't enjoy writing in general, but it was nice to be able show my appreciation by wrting my partners a feedback. They all have been very king and helpful.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</h5>
          <p>
          I found it difficult to make my feedback sound more actionable. According to my meta feedback, that is what my feedback lacks the most. I will try to improve that part of my feedback.
