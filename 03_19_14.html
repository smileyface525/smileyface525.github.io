			Most of us heard of JavaScript before. It has something to do with internet, or more precisely, websites.But what is it? What does it do? Why do web developers use it? Let’s see if we can answer these questions.<br>
			First of all, JavaScript is a programming language.  It’s typically used with HTML and CSS to make a website more powerful in many different ways.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>JavaScript can respond to the users quickly</h4>
					<p>Say you are shopping online and see something you like and you click on the product. If the shopping cart is JavaScript-powered, it can immediately tell you the price, tax, shipping cost and so forth. Or if you’re filing out a form, a JavaScript-powered form can tell you if you’re missing required fields even before you hit the submit button. This is very helpful because you don’t have to wait for the page to take you back to the form whenever there’s an error.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>JavaScript makes a website more fun, dynamic and interactive</h4>
					<p>We’ve all seen a sideshow on web at least once. It’s very cool and more fun than a picture gallery. JavaScript can make that. And those small boxes that pop up when you click on an icon or picture (they are called ‘tooltips’) are made by JavaScript too! JavaScript can watch your action you make on a website and responds to you whenever it can to help you get more information easily.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>JavaScript organizes information</h4>
					<p>With JavaScript, a website can show sub tables when a user hovers their mouse over an item on a list. JavaScript can also make tabbed panels so a web page is not overcrowded by information. These functions may not be necessary, but they are extremely useful because they help the users navigate through a website with ease.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So now we know why JavaScript is so popular!</p>
