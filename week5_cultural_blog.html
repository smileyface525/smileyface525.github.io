				There is no denying that we are becoming more and more dependent of technology. Because of that, technology is becoming cheaper and better. As world's need for technology grows however, more and more of us are getting concerned that our privacy is in danger. Electronic monitoring of people, interception and reading of emails, companies sharing customers' private information and so forth. Technology's ability to invade our privacy is endless.<br><br>
				On the other hand, I don't think any of us are willing to give up the good side of technology either. So the question is 'do we really need to give up technology if we want our privacy?'. But the truth is that some technology actually helps protect our privacy. Banks prevent fraud by sharing information about people who are going from one bank to another committing illegal acts such as trying to pass checks. In an effort to combat terrorism, banks are required to notify the federal government when certain transactions meet the guideline that are deemed suspicious by law. Seung-Hui Cho massacred thirty two people at Virginia Tech. The incident happened despite the fact that he had serious mental problems and was considered very dangerous. This tragedy might have been avoided if the aforementioned type of information was included in the normal background checks that are performed when somebody tries to purchase a firearm. <br><br>
				So maybe we don't need to give up technology as long as there is a balance between taking advantage of technology and overuse of it. As technology improves, we have to be responsible and  be conscious about both good and bad sides of technology.
