					<h4>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h4>
					<p>
						Recently I had an argument with my co-worker Jeff. He had been making small mistakes for a while and my boss, who doesn't usually work with him asked me to have a duscussion with Jeff about how to fix the problem. So I talked to him the next day and asked him what he thinks is the best way to eliminate mistakes. He was cooperative for a lille while but then he started pointing out other people's mistakes and got upset. That's when we had the argument.  
					</p>
				</li>

					<h4>What was the source of the conflict?</h4>
					<p>
						Basiaccly Jeff thoguht that the boss should have had a discussion with him  in person instead of me doing it for her. So he started venting all of his complaints and emotions out to me.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How did you handle that conflict?</h4>
					<p>
						In the beginning I was trying to be calm and to just listen to him. And even though I did not feel comfortable, I was doing a decent job listening until he started pointing my mistakes. Then I ended up yelling at him once.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h4>
					<p>
						I'm not sure if it did anything. I guess it worked in a way because he stopped complaing and yelling.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h4>
					<p>
						I would not yell and I should have just listened to him and told the boss to talk to him later.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>What did you learn from this experience?</h4>
					<p>
						When someone is angry, let them vent and don't take it personally. This conflict was a good lesson for me because when I'm with angry people, I tend to get intimidated and get angry myself, which is not a good pattern!
